For demo

	

Before release

- clean up / document
- host on bitbucket
- status object
- multiple post scripts
- platform-sensitive install (paths for Java, Python)
- Python 3
- script runs in any directory
- sanity check on eval-only: has the config changed too much?
- detect: item-based similarity vs user-based, detect ranking vs prediction metrics
- AutoPath object to avoid path issues in future
-
